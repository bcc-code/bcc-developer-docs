# Authentication

## Concept

The BCC Membership API allows to either be authenticated as an organization or as an end user. Typically in order to authenticated as an end user an id\_token should be provided and in order to authenticate as an organization an api-key should be provided. 

### Authentication as an end user

Normally authentication through an end-user happens via a client \(web or mobile app\). The client in such a case will be responsible for logging the user in via an identity provider and thus receiving an id\_token which the server will except. All request from the client to the server will then be accompanied with id\_token. In the server the request will then be executed in the context of the end user and based on he permissions of the end user

### Authenticating as an organization

Authenticating as an organization can happen by provider and api-key. The api-key can be obtained by contacting Service Center \(servicesenter@bcc.no\).
